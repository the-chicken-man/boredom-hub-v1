Villages, mine shafts, dungeons, caves, ravines, many different biomes, and other things can spawn. The Nether and End are also available.

<h1>Servers</h1>
Go to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230205110931/https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PhUJSb0ojMyhv1Fs8bmVqwANBkySOgdyfRinJto3xnE/edit"<a>this doc</a> (had to use the wayback machine) to get <b>a list of Multiplayer Server Adresses.</b> I do not own it or edit it in any way.

<h1>IMPORTANT!</h1>

<p>
When you create a new world, it will be a black screen, or you may have spawned underground. <b>ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS WAIT 1–5 MINUTES!</b> It will fix on its own. It will also be laggy at first, but it will smooth out after 5–10 minutes. <b>Keep in mind that this is an old version of Minecraft and that not everything in the real current Minecraft will be avialable.</b>
