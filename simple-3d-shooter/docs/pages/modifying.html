# Modifying the code

This game code was written using JavaScript ES6+ to support the most modern features (like imports, constructors, etc), and needs to be "transpiled" to JavaScript ES5 due to compatibility with old browsers (because some old browsers don't support ES6+). You can see more about it [here](about_code.html).

Then, before modifying the code, you will need to install the tools to transpile it. Don't worry, we used the simplest tools to help you.

To care about assets compilation and code transpilation, we used the [Laravel Mix Tool](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/mix), that provides a fluent API for defining [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) build steps. You can use **Webpack** or your preferred tools if you want, but we chose **Laravel Mix** due to the facility to set up and use with a few lines of code.

## 1 - Installing Tools and Modules

Firstly, you will need to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) and **NPM** on your system. NPM is installed by default with **NodeJS** installation.

Then you can check if these two are installed with the commands below:

```
node -v
npm -v
```

If this is OK, enter the project main folder (the folder with package.json) and run:

```
npm install
```

This will install all the Node Modules inside the project inside the folder **node\_modules**. Be sure of never uploading this folder to your server or committing it to a repository (we added a rule to the **.gitignore** to prevent it).

## 2 - Compiling the assets

And then, you can compile your assets inside the game main folder, generating the **app.js** and **vendor.js** inside the **public/build/** folder: 

For development, you can run a Watcher, that verifies and compiles your scripts ever you modify them: 
```
npm run watch
```

Or, to compile and version the development scripts once, without watching, run:
```
npm run dev
```

And, after your modifications are OK, and you want to publish your code, **we highly recommend** to compile the production scripts, running:
```
npm run production
```

This command will minify and uglify the files, reducing their sizes for production environments.

All the assets that can be compiled are in the **/src** folder and the compiled assets are saved in the **/public/build** folder. 

You can see and set the Assets Compilation Settings inside the **webpack.mix.js** file.

If you want to know more about the compilation/transpilation process, please see the [Laravel Mix Documentation here](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/mix).

## 3 - About CSS

As the game has little CSS, we added it to **index.html**.
