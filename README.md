# boredom-hub-v1
This is the utmost hub for boredom at school.
Created by one person with a dream of bypassing the restrictions that hold students down, students should be able to play at school and have fun, not just sit mindlessly at a desk. That is why I created Boredom hub, A Website where you aren't limited by evil software like securly or landschool.
so please check out the website, fork your own version and see what we are all about.

ALSO, if the main link does not work here are all the links I made so far other than the main link
